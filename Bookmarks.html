    <P > Computer engineering is where computer science and electrical engineering meet.
         Computer engineers design, build and debug the hardware required to run all kinds of computers — from phones,
          airplanes and communications networks to medical devices.
        
          The Major in Computer Engineering helps you develop a depth and breadth of expertise in computer hardware and
           software and will allow you to engage with theoretical and practical issues in well-equipped laboratories.
        
           The program is designed to meet the growing industry demand for engineers with a strong background in modern
            computer technology. You will graduate with the foundational knowledge required for graduate studies in all 
            fields of Computer Engineering.</P>

     <p> Electrical and electronics engineering, the branch of engineering concerned with the practical applications of
         electricity in all its forms, including those of the field of electronics. Electronics engineering is that branch
          of electrical engineering concerned with the uses of the electromagnetic spectrum and with the application of such 
          electronic devices as integrated circuits and transistors.

        In engineering practice, the distinction between electrical engineering and electronics is usually based on the
         comparative strength of the electric currents used. In this sense, electrical engineering is the branch dealing
          with “heavy current”—that is, electric light and power systems and apparatuses—whereas electronics engineering 
          deals with such “light current” applications as telephone and radio communication, computers, radar, and automatic 
          control systems.

     <p> Mechanical engineering is the application of the principles and problem-solving techniques of engineering from 
        design to manufacturing to the marketplace for any object. Mechanical engineers analyze their work using the 
        principles of motion, energy, and force—ensuring that designs function safely, efficiently, and reliably,
         all at a competitive cost.

        Mechanical engineers make a difference. That's because mechanical engineering careers center on creating
         technologies to meet human needs. Virtually every product or service in modern life has probably been touched
          in some way by a mechanical engineer to help humankind.
        
        This includes solving today's problems and creating future solutions in health care, energy, transportation,
         world hunger, space exploration, climate change, and more.

    <p> Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance 
        of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports,
         sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.

        Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It is considered the second-oldest engineering
         discipline after military engineering,[3] and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering.
         Civil engineering can take place in the public sector from municipal public works departments through to federal government
          agencies, and in the private sector from locally based firms to global Fortune 500 companies.
